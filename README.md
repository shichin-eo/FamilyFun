# FamilyFun

## About project
The idea to create this project came up when I tried to ask myself:
  - What series we (me and my wife) have watched? 
  - What season are we staying on?
  - How much money we can spend this month?
  - etc.
### Description
FamilyFun portal for everyday life. The portal includes two main areas: Family and Fun.  
The first area includes: budget, gallery, etc.

The second area, called Fun, is designed for leisure activities.
